## Python Scripts Overview

### **1. changes.py**
**Purpose:**  
Handles all functionalities related to managing service changes. It provides operations to create, update, delete, and retrieve service change records. This script ensures that service-related changes are properly logged and validated.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Create new service change records.
- Update existing change records with the latest information.
- Delete outdated or unnecessary change records.
- Query specific service changes based on user-defined criteria.
- Integrate with external data sources to synchronize service-related updates.

---

### **2. contacts.py**
**Purpose:**  
Manages contact information related to service changes. This script focuses on maintaining accurate and up-to-date records for customers and other stakeholders.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Store and retrieve contact details such as names, emails, and phone numbers.
- Associate contacts with specific service changes for better traceability.
- Handle updates to contact information when changes occur.
- Validate contact details to ensure compliance with formatting and required fields.

---

### **3. utils.py**
**Purpose:**  
A utility script that provides common helper functions used across the application. This script abstracts repetitive tasks to promote code reuse and maintainability.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Validate and clean incoming data for consistency and accuracy.
- Provide logging functionalities for tracking application activity.
- Handle file operations, such as reading from or writing to CSV/JSON files.
- Parse and format data to meet required specifications for integration with external systems.

## Data Flow

1. **Service Change Creation:**  
   New service changes are created through `changes.py` and linked to relevant customer contacts using `contacts.py`.

2. **Data Validation:**  
   Incoming data from external sources is processed through `utils.py` to ensure it meets required standards before being used in the application.

3. **Integration:**  
   Data from `changes.py` and `contacts.py` can be exported to external systems or used for generating reports, making the application versatile and extensible.

4. **Traceability:**  
   Each service change is associated with a contact, ensuring clear traceability for auditing or customer support purposes.
